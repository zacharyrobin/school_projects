# COEN 20: Introduction to Embedded Systems
Introduction to computer organization: CPU, registers, buses, memory, I/O interfaces. Number systems: arithmetic and information representation. Assembly language programming: addressing techniques, arithmetic and logic operations, branching and looping, stack operations, procedure calls, parameter passing, and interrupts. C language programming: pointers, memory management, stack frames, interrupt processing

# CSCI 60: Object Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming techniques using C++: abstract data types and objects; encapsulation; inheritance; polymorphism; the Standard Template Library; the five phases of software development (specification, design, implementation, analysis, and testing).

# CSCI 61: Data Structures
Specification, implementations, and analysis of basic data structures (stacks, queues, graphs, hash tables, binary trees) and their applications in sorting and searching algorithms. 

# CSCI 187: Design Management of Softwar
Design and implementation of large software projects, including building in a group a quarter-long programming project. In addition to discussing and enacting the systems development life cycle, students learn the basics of user experience design and formal software verification.
